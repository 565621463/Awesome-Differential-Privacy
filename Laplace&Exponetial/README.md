# 1. Start
You can run the `differential_privacy.py` to evaluate both of mechanisms, or you could choose to run the other two file respectively in `src` directory.

# 2. Laplace Mechanism
If you want to know more about the basic theory, I really recommend this paper.

# 3. Exponential Mechanism

If you want to know more about the basic theory, I really recommend this paper.
